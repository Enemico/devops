SERVICE = intangible elements around a product, such as: 
	
	* SLA
	* UX
	* support
	* performance
	* taking the risks of delivery
	* taking the costs of delivery
	* deliver an OUTCOME that is VALUE

VALUE = a result of the combination of:

	* UTILITY it does what the customer is looking for ( functional requirements ) - fit for purpose 
	* WARRANTY it is fit for purpose: continuity of delivery, SLA / availability, security, capacity ( non functional requirements ) - fit for use
	
It is NOT only a financial term


BUSINESS CASE = a justification for a process of delivery
	* requirements
	* costs
	* objective

AGILE
	* smaller, frequent releases
	* smaller development time
	* easier to identify errors early, when fixing is cheap
	* QUALITY IS BUILT IN from he beginning
	* automation minimize human error in processes with high levels of routine
	* high level of involvment of operations to minimize downtime

DASA: Devops Agile Skills Association

COMPETENCE SKILLS
	* courage
	* teambuilding
	* leadership
	* continuous improvement

KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
	* architecture / design 
	* business value optimization
	* business analysis
	* infrastructure engineering
	* security risk and compliance
	* testing
	* programming
	* continuous delivery

CHALLENGES: 
	* incidents ( loss of customer satisfaction and trust )
	* manual processes cause errors
	* backlog ( lack of staff )
	* infrequent releases, or releases implementing features that are not required by the business
	* organizational silos
	* different mindsets, tools, environments ( test, staging, prod )
	* blame game
	* no feedback loops
	* lack of interest in learning each others' tools

Tension between Change and Stability ( wall of confusion )
	* well defined responsibilities are needed 

ANTIFRAGILITY
	* getting better as a consequence of shock, disruption and disorder
	* it means thriving on stressors
	* going beyond resilience and robustness
	* startups are antifragile, large organizations are fragile
	* short devops loops USE disruption to improve a service


REASONS TO DO DEVOPS
	1 * improved speed to market ( faster delivery , agile )
	2 * continuous integration and delivery ( faster, agile ): automated testing, automated build, auomtated release
	3 * higher quality built in, fewer failures, more stability
	4 * innovative process
	5 * employees are empowered, more responsible and more happy
	6 * more collaboration in the company, remove compartimentation remove waste of time, waiting, and augment communication and awareness
	7 * reduced costs

DEVOPS IS A CULTURAL AND OPERATIONAL MODEL THAT FOSTERS COLLABORATION TO ENABLE HIGH-PERFORMANCE IT TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS GOALS

DEVOPS CORE PRINCIPLES	

	1 * customer centric action ( short feedback loop ) 
		- no bureaucracy
		- no fear of asking questions 
		- take risks ( uncertainty in the future ), but calculated ones
		- innovate freely / experiment / fail fast

	2 * create with end in mind ( understand the real needs of customers )
		- know where you are, where you want to go, how to get here, involve key stakeholders
		- not a process oriented model, but oversee the complete picture
		- focus on product value
		- MVP
		- small batches deliveries to get feedback about value

	3 * end to end responsibility ( the whole team is accountable )
		- if you builid it, you run it: you create a work pattern and you are more likely to "be it"

	4 * cross functional and autonomous teams, taking own decisions
		- T shaped profiles with breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise
		- Complementary skills
		- give positive feedback 
		- high trust
		- no heroes in devops

	5 * continuous improvement
		- if it hurts, do it more often
		- fail fast
		- experiment
		- measure everything, if it's not measurable, cannot be improved ( perf, process, innovation, culture, support )
		- LEARN

	6 * automate as much as possible
		- manual action fails
		- high routine = high risk
		- plan, do, check, act
		- continuous improvement is helped by automation
		- continuous delivery use automation to get into production fast and often
		- cloud replace datacenter
		- container based infrastructure ( infrastructure as code ) 

STRUCTURED PROBLEM SOLVING

	1: DMAIC
		* DEFINE a symptom and describe the problem, ensure stakeholders agree on scope of problem
		* MEASURE collecting data, validate the data
		* ANALYZE and structure data, find cause of the problem
		* IMPROVE solution alternatives, choose one
		* CONTROL anchor a change, learn a lesson

	2: KAIZEN
		* See problem 
		* Solve problem
		* Share lesson: WHY?
